#### dp_algorithms.py

Implementation of PriDP and DomDP (Algorithms 4.1 and 4.2) to compute the stepsize schedules.

It also provides numerical verification of the worst-case bound using the [PEPit](https://pepit.readthedocs.io/en/0.4.0/) package.

    
#### verify_conjecture.py

Verification of the Conjecture in **Subsection: Nonuniqueness** for $n\leq 10^4$.
